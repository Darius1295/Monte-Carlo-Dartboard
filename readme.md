# Monte Carlo Dartboard

#### This program is an attempt to answer the following question using a simulation:

##### This function answers the question using a Monte Carlo simulation:

```
prob_count_board(n,d,m,x)
```
##### Print this function to get an approximation to the question. x is the number of iterations. The higher x is, the more accurate the answer will be, and the longer it will take to compute.

##### Print this function to approximate the probability that at least half the squares in the dartboard will be empty with a Monte Carlo simulation with x number of iterations.

```
prob_half_squares_empty(n,d,x):
```
